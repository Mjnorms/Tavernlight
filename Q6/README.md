#Flash Ability

Created an ability called flash that teleports the player one space ahead some designated number of times  
I wrote a frag shader to put an outline around the player, but ran out of time trying to hook it up to the draw system.
In hindsight I should have done that first, but I'm confident I could have got it working with a little more time.
I attempted to create a module in order to have some input on the client-side that was attached to when the ability was cast.
