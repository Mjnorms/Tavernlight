# Tavernlight Programming Take-Home
Working in the OTClient/TFS was enjoyable! It was my first experience with Tibia as a whole so there was a bit of a learning curve, but the possibilities of such a compact server/client engine are pretty wide.
It was fun to explore and learn, after the classic initial workspace setup woes.  

Q1-Q3 are in a single LUA file  
Q4 is the cpp file  
Q5 and Q7 are complete  
Q6 is WIP; I ran out of time after a busy week.
